# Gender-classification-using-YOLOv7
This project involves building a real-time gender classification system using the YOLOv7 object detection model. The system detects faces in images or video frames and classifies them as male or female based on visual features.

The model was trained on a labeled dataset containing human faces annotated with gender classes. By leveraging YOLOv7â€™s speed and accuracy, the system performs efficient detection and classification in a single forward pass, making it suitable for deployment in applications such as surveillance, smart kiosks, or demographic analytics.
